# AI-and-ML-Projects
This repository contains various Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) projects that I am working on. Each project explores different aspects of AI and ML, from basic neural networks to applied AI in healthcare and traffic management.

Project Overview
1. CNN on MNIST Dataset
File: CNN_MNIST.ipynb
Description: This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained and evaluated to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.
Key Features:
Data preprocessing and augmentation
CNN architecture with multiple convolutional layers
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix
2. Basic Neural Network Model
File: Basic_Neural_Network_Model.ipynb
Description: This project involves building a simple feedforward neural network for classification tasks. It serves as a fundamental introduction to neural networks and their implementation.
Key Features:
Implementation of a fully connected neural network
Backpropagation algorithm
Hyperparameter tuning
3. Brain Tumor Detection
File: Brain Tumor Detection.ipynb
Description: This project applies machine learning techniques to detect brain tumors from medical imaging data. The model is designed to assist in early diagnosis and improve treatment outcomes.
Key Features:
Data preprocessing and segmentation
Feature extraction using CNNs
Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
4. Traffic Management System
File: Traffic Management System.ipynb
Description: This project focuses on developing an intelligent traffic management system using AI techniques. The system aims to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion in urban areas.
Key Features:
Real-time traffic data analysis
Predictive modeling for traffic flow
Simulation of traffic scenarios and evaluation
